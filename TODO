- Your settings -> Resend confirmation (only if unconfirmed)
- Concept of current space
  - can be localized for bookmarker
- in all notes, show only notes from current space
- in boards, show only boards from current space
- when adding a board, add to current space
- leave a space (in edit screen)
- Update bookmarker to just take a URL
  - all scraping happens in-app
  - look for og:image tags before doing image/div bg-imag scan
- moving boards to a new space should move notes locally, but NOT sync them
  - sync records will come from server directly
