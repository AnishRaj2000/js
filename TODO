- Update bookmarker
  - should be aware of spaces, have space selector
  - bookmarker should accept a URL, fill in the rest itself (title, thumbnail, desc)
  - should save last space/last board used
- formcontroller :require_connection doesnt disable button on first render
  - ex: add space invite when disconnected
