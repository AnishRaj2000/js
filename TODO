# Interface notes
- Get rid of title for "All notes"/"Boards"/"<boardtitle>"
  - instead, space title (w/ color) will be the main title for all note
    interfaces
- get rid of "All notes"/"Boards" subnav...two interface ideas:
  - keep spaces in ham menu, replace subnav with slack's "channel" bar (but for
    boards). would drop down board interface similar to current.
  - in ham manu, have spaces as square icons (color/first two of space name)
    - would be obvious via highlighting which space is selected
	- would show all boards and have options for sharing.
	- implement three-dot menu for note pages
	  - get rid of user bar in ham menu, move to three-dot
	  - add "Share this space" to three dot
- drive everything by url:
  - /<spaceid>/notes -- all notes
  - /<spaceid>/notes/<boardid> -- board notes
  - /<spaceid>/sharing -- sharing

- default space: first space selected when logging in
- Your settings -> Resend confirmation (only if unconfirmed)
- Concept of current space
  - can be localized for bookmarker
- in all notes, show only notes from current space
- in boards, show only boards from current space
- when adding a board, add to current space
- leave a space (in edit screen)
- Update bookmarker to just take a URL
  - all scraping happens in-app
  - look for og:image tags before doing image/div bg-imag scan
- moving boards to a new space should move notes locally, but NOT sync them
  - sync records will come from server directly
