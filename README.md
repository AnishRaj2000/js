[Turtl](https://turtl.it/)
==========================

This is the core of the Turtl app. It can act as a standalone web app but is
mainly meant to be wrapped either by the [desktop app](https://github.com/turtl/desktop)
or the (now deprecated) [chrome](https://github.com/turtl/chrome) and
[firefox](https://github.com/turtl/firefox) extensions.

and how it fits in with the other Turtl components.
